# Game Proposal: Rhythm Defense

## Overview
A unique hybrid tower defense and rhythm game where players defend their base by strategically placing towers and activating them in sync with the music. Success requires both tactical planning and rhythmic execution.

## Category
Primary: Strategy
Secondary: Arcade

## Core Mechanics

### Tower Defense Elements
- Grid-based map layout (12x8 grid)
- Multiple tower types with unique abilities:
  - Beam Tower: Sustained damage in straight line
  - Pulse Tower: Area of effect damage
  - Shield Tower: Temporary defensive barrier
  - Boost Tower: Enhances adjacent towers
- Resource management (Energy points for tower placement)
- Enemy waves with varied patterns and resistances
- Strategic tower positioning and upgrading

### Rhythm Elements
- Beat-matching activation system
  - Towers must be activated on beat for maximum effectiveness
  - Perfect timing yields 2x damage
  - Good timing yields 1.5x damage
  - Missed beats reduce tower effectiveness by 50%
- Combo system for consecutive perfect activations
- Dynamic beat patterns based on enemy types
- Power-ups that appear on specific beat markers
- Musical intensity increases with wave difficulty

### Progression System
- Level-based campaign with increasing complexity
- Unlockable tower types and upgrades
- Multiple difficulty modes affecting both rhythm and strategy elements
- High score system with combo multipliers
- Achievement system for mastering different play styles

## Target Audience
- Primary: Strategy game enthusiasts looking for a fresh twist
- Secondary: Rhythm game players interested in tactical elements
- Age Range: 12+ (complexity of mechanics)
- Play Session Length: 10-15 minutes per level

## Unique Selling Points
1. Novel Genre Fusion
   - Seamless integration of rhythm and strategy mechanics
   - Each genre complements rather than compromises the other
   - Appeals to both strategy and rhythm game fans

2. Dynamic Difficulty Scaling
   - Strategy complexity increases with new enemy types
   - Rhythm patterns become more challenging
   - Multiple victory conditions for different skill levels

3. Audiovisual Synergy
   - Visual effects synchronized with music
   - Tower activations contribute to the soundtrack
   - Enemy movements follow musical patterns

4. Replayability
   - Multiple valid strategies for each level
   - Score attack mode for competitive players
   - Daily challenges with unique constraints

## Technical Considerations

### Audio System
- Web Audio API for precise timing
- Dynamic audio mixing for tower effects
- Beat detection and synchronization system
- Preloaded audio assets to prevent latency

### Visual System
- Canvas-based rendering for performance
- Particle system for tower effects
- Grid overlay for tower placement
- Visual beat markers and timing indicators
- Responsive layout scaling

### Input Handling
- Keyboard mapping for tower activation (1-4 keys)
- Mouse/Touch for tower placement and selection
- Input buffering for rhythm sequences
- Accessibility options for timing windows

### Performance Optimization
- Sprite batching for particle effects
- Audio buffer management
- Efficient collision detection
- Target: 60fps on mid-range devices

# Arcade Hub Game Development Process

This document outlines the process for developing and publishing games on the Arcade Hub platform. It provides a structured approach for ideation, development, testing, and publication.

## 1. Ideation Phase

### Game Idea Template

When proposing a new game, use the following template to structure your idea:

```markdown
# Game Proposal: [Game Title]

## Overview
[1-2 sentence description of the game concept]

## Category
[Primary category: Arcade, Puzzle, Strategy, or Educational]

## Core Mechanics
[Bullet points describing the main gameplay mechanics]

## Target Audience
[Description of the intended players]

## Unique Selling Points
[What makes this game special or interesting]

## Technical Considerations
[Any special technical requirements or challenges]

## Development Estimate
[Rough estimate of development time]

## References/Inspiration
[Similar games or inspirations]
```

### Evaluation Criteria

Game ideas will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Alignment with Platform**: How well the game fits with the Arcade Hub aesthetic and audience
2. **Technical Feasibility**: Whether the game can be implemented with our technology stack
3. **Uniqueness**: How the game differentiates from existing offerings
4. **Scope**: Whether the development effort is reasonable
5. **Appeal**: The potential audience interest and engagement

### Prioritization

Game ideas will be prioritized based on:

1. Strategic value to the platform
2. Resource availability
3. Estimated development time
4. Potential user engagement
5. Technical complexity

## 2. Development Phase

### Setup

1. Create a new directory in the `games` folder with your game's ID
2. Set up the basic file structure:
   ```
   games/your-game-id/
   ├── index.html
   ├── game.js
   └── style.css (optional)
   ```
3. Add a thumbnail image to `images/your-game-id.jpg` (400x300px recommended)

### Development Guidelines

#### HTML Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Game Title - Arcade Hub</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <a href="/" class="back-button">← Back to Arcade Hub</a>
        <h1>Game Title</h1>
    </header>
    
    <main>
        <!-- Game container -->
        <div id="game-container">
            <!-- Game canvas or elements go here -->
        </div>
        
        <!-- Controls explanation -->
        <div class="controls-info">
            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>Explain the controls and basic rules here.</p>
        </div>
    </main>
    
    <!-- Include the shared high score system -->
    <script src="/js/main.js"></script>
    <!-- Include your game script -->
    <script src="game.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### JavaScript Structure

```javascript
// Game configuration
const CONFIG = {
    // Game-specific settings
};

// Game state
let gameState = {
    // Variables to track game state
};

// Game initialization
function initGame() {
    // Setup code
}

// Main game loop
function gameLoop() {
    update();
    render();
    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

// Update game state
function update() {
    // Update logic
}

// Render game
function render() {
    // Drawing code
}

// Event handlers
function handleInput(event) {
    // Input handling
}

// High score integration
function checkHighScore(score) {
    if (HighScores.isHighScore('your-game-id', score)) {
        HighScores.showHighScoreForm('your-game-id', score);
    }
}

// Initialize the game when the page loads
window.addEventListener('load', initGame);
```

#### Using the High Score System

```javascript
// Check if a score qualifies as a high score
if (HighScores.isHighScore('your-game-id', playerScore)) {
    // Show the high score input form
    HighScores.showHighScoreForm('your-game-id', playerScore);
}

// Display high scores
HighScores.showHighScores('your-game-id');
```

### Development Best Practices

1. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the game works on different screen sizes
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Provide fallbacks for older browsers
3. **Performance Optimization**: Minimize DOM operations and optimize rendering
4. **Code Organization**: Use clear function and variable names
5. **Comments**: Document complex logic and algorithms
6. **Error Handling**: Implement graceful error handling
7. **Asset Optimization**: Compress images and audio files

## 3. Testing Phase

## 4. Publication Process

### Submission Requirements

To submit a game for publication:

1. Complete all items on the testing checklist
2. Ensure code follows the project's coding standards
3. Prepare game metadata according to the Game Categories document
4. Create a pull request with your game files

### Review Process

Submitted games will go through the following review process:

1. **Initial Review**: Check for completeness and adherence to guidelines
2. **Code Review**: Evaluate code quality and organization
3. **Gameplay Testing**: Test the game for fun factor and user experience
4. **Performance Review**: Check for performance issues
5. **Final Approval**: Final decision on publication

### Publication Steps

Once approved, the game will be published through these steps:

1. Merge the pull request to the main branch
2. Add the game metadata to the main games registry
3. Update the homepage to include the new game
4. Deploy the updated site to production
5. Announce the new game on relevant channels

### Post-Publication

After publication:

1. Monitor for any issues or bugs
2. Collect user feedback
3. Consider improvements or updates based on feedback
4. Track engagement metrics

## 5. Maintenance and Updates

### Version Control

All game updates should follow these version control practices:

1. Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
2. Document changes in a changelog
3. Create separate branches for major updates

### Update Process

To update an existing game:

1. Create a branch for your updates
2. Make and test your changes
3. Update the version number
4. Submit a pull request
5. After review, merge and deploy

### Deprecation Policy

Games may be deprecated if:

1. They use outdated technologies that pose security risks
2. They have significant performance issues
3. They no longer meet the platform's quality standards
4. They have very low engagement metrics

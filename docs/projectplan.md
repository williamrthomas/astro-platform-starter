Free or Low-Cost Hosting Solutions for an HTML Games Webpage

Hosting Platforms for Static HTML5 Games

To host a simple arcade-style site (HTML/CSS/JS only), static hosting services are ideal. They are free or low-cost and handle deployment, hosting, and SSL for you:
	•	GitHub Pages: A free static hosting service by GitHub. You push your site to a repository and GitHub serves it. It’s great for open-source projects and can handle high traffic without cost. HTML5 games (being just HTML/JS/CSS) work well on GitHub Pages ￼. You can even use a custom domain easily via a CNAME file ￼. The drawback is that it’s tied to GitHub and primarily meant for static content (no server-side code).
	•	Netlify: A popular static hosting platform with a generous free tier. Netlify is known for its ease of use – you can connect your Git repo and it auto-deploys on each push. It provides continuous deployment, global CDN, free SSL, and even form handling or functions if needed (on the free plan). One developer noted that Netlify is “the absolute easiest solution for static site hosting. And it’s free! … an absolute breeze to use” ￼. Netlify’s free tier supports pretty large bandwidth (100GB/month) before you’d need to pay ￼, which is plenty for a small games site.
	•	Vercel: Another excellent option, Vercel offers a free Hobby plan for personal projects ￼. It’s the company behind Next.js, but you can deploy any static site or front-end project. Like Netlify, it integrates with Git for quick deployment and provides automatic SSL and global edge network by default ￼. Vercel is very developer-friendly, especially if you might use modern frameworks. For a plain HTML/JS arcade site, it’s still easy – just drag-and-drop deploy or connect a repo. One consideration: Vercel’s free tier is also quite generous, but if you ever needed serverless functions or advanced features, those exist too (though you likely won’t need them for this use-case).
	•	Others (Cloudflare Pages, etc.): There are other free static hosts as well. Cloudflare Pages offers free hosting with Git integration and very fast CDN (useful if your audience is global). Surge is a CLI-based static host that’s free for basic use and super simple (good for quick drops of a folder). Any of these can serve a static games site. The key is they all require no backend server setup – just upload your files and they’re served globally.

Why static hosting? All these services handle the heavy lifting of hosting a website without a traditional server. This means you avoid server costs and maintenance. As one article noted, hosting HTML5 games on a service like GitHub Pages is ideal if you want to “host any website without backend… and you don’t want to pay too much for hosting” ￼. Netlify and Vercel similarly provide free hosting with benefits like automatic HTTPS, which makes setup and maintenance very easy ￼.

Client-Side Filtering by Labels/Tags

On your homepage, you want to show a grid of games (say 9 random picks) and allow filtering by genre or tags. This can be done entirely on the client side (in the browser) with a bit of JavaScript or a small library:
	•	Using a Library (List.js): Libraries like List.js can add search and filter capabilities to an HTML list or grid with minimal code. List.js is a “tiny, invisible and simple, yet powerful” JS library that adds search, sorting, and filtering to plain HTML lists ￼. You could list all your games in the HTML (with data attributes or classes for their tags), and List.js can enable real-time filtering (and even searching) through them ￼. This saves you from writing the filtering logic from scratch.
	•	Custom JavaScript Filter: If you prefer not to use an external library, filtering by tags can be implemented in a few lines of vanilla JS. One simple approach is to give each game thumbnail element a class corresponding to its genre/tags (e.g., class=“game tile puzzle action”). Then, have buttons or checkboxes for each tag that, when clicked, hide/show the relevant elements. For example, a “Puzzle” button would loop through all game items and only display those with the “puzzle” class. This approach was demonstrated in a small CodePen – essentially toggling the CSS display of elements based on a data-tag attribute or class name ￼. It doesn’t require any framework: just use document.querySelectorAll to get the game items and adjust their .style.display or classes on filter events.
	•	Animated or Advanced Filtering: If you want fancy animated filtering (like items reordering with a nice animation, as seen on some portfolio sites), there are plugins like MixItUp or Isotope. MixItUp (free for non-commercial projects) allows animated filtering and sorting of DOM elements and is used often for galleries ￼. These might be overkill for a simple site, but are options if you desire that polished feel. They require adding their JS library and initializing with your items’ classes/categories.

In summary, for simplicity, using a small library like List.js or a few lines of custom JS will handle tag-based filtering. This keeps everything on the front-end — the page loads all games (or a lot of them), and the user can dynamically filter them without any server calls.

Arcade-Style High Score System (Client-Side)

For the retro “enter your initials” high score feature, you can implement a client-side high score board. The idea is to store scores in the user’s browser so they persist between visits without needing a server database:
	•	Browser Local Storage: HTML5’s Local Storage API is perfect for this. It allows you to save data (strings) in the browser that persist even after the page is closed, up to a few MB. This is commonly used in web games for saving high scores or game state ￼ ￼. You can use localStorage.setItem() to save a score or score table, and localStorage.getItem() to retrieve it later ￼. For example, when a game ends and you have the player’s score and their entered initials, you could update a “highScores” list in local storage:
	1.	Retrieve the existing high score list (e.g., JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('highScores'))).
	2.	Add the new score (initials + score) to that list, then sort the list to keep the highest scores at top.
	3.	Trim the list to, say, top 10 scores (if you want to limit how many are stored).
	4.	Save the updated list back to localStorage (localStorage.setItem('highScores', JSON.stringify(list))).
Next time the page loads (or on a high score screen), you read from localStorage and display the stored top scores.
LocalStorage is very easy to use and widely supported, and as one game-dev article notes, it’s “an ideal way to save game progress and high scores in HTML5 games” ￼ without any server.
	•	Library Helpers: While you can use the localStorage API directly, there are tiny libraries like store.js or Lockr that simplify it (they let you store objects directly, handle JSON behind the scenes, and provide convenience methods). These aren’t strictly necessary, but they can make code a bit cleaner. For instance, store.js would let you do store.set("highScores", array) and store.get("highScores") without needing to stringify/parse. Such libraries are basically wrappers for localStorage that “provide additional methods and features” beyond the basic API ￼. If your needs are simple, vanilla localStorage is fine, but it’s good to know these exist.
	•	No-Backend High Scores: By keeping scores local, each user’s high score table is saved client-side (like how old arcade machines kept scores until unplugged!). This means you don’t need any backend, which fits your “no complex backend” requirement. The limitation is that users only see their own scores. If you wanted a global leaderboard (everyone competing for high scores), that would require a server or cloud database to store and retrieve scores from all users. That route can get complicated and has security issues – without careful design, people could manipulate client data and submit fake scores ￼. Many developers accept that a local high score is enough for casual games. It gives the 80s arcade vibe (the scores reset per machine/browser), and avoids needing user accounts or server validation. You could always expand later, but to start, localStorage is the simplest solution for a high score list stored by initials on the user’s side.

Social Sharing Integration

Adding social sharing buttons will let users share a game or their high score on platforms like Twitter or Facebook. There are two main ways to do this, both of which can be done with minimal setup on a static page:
	•	Use a Social Sharing Widget: The quickest method is to embed a ready-made sharing tool from services like ShareThis or AddThis. These services provide free share button plugins that you can drop into your site. For example, ShareThis offers customizable blocks of social media icons that handle all the popup dialogs and linking for you ￼. Typically, you sign up (free), configure which buttons (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) you want, and they give you a snippet of HTML/JS to include. Once added, you’ll see a nice set of share icons on your page that users can click to share the page or a specific URL. The upside: super easy and quick, no need to manually code the logic for each network. The downside: the embedded script can slightly impact performance or add tracking, but for many projects this is a non-issue.
	•	Manual Share Links (Lightweight Approach): If you prefer not to include third-party scripts, you can create your own share buttons using the social networks’ share URLs. Many social platforms allow URL-based sharing. For instance, a Twitter share link looks like:

https://twitter.com/share?url=<GAME_URL>&text=<TEXT_TO_SHARE>&via=<YOUR_TWITTER>

You can make a Twitter button that points to a URL like that (with the game’s URL and a message prefilled). Clicking it opens Twitter’s share dialog with that content ￼. Facebook has a similar sharer URL (e.g., https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=<GAME_URL>). You’d do this for each platform you care about – essentially hardcode the links or generate them with JS for each game. This method keeps your site lightweight (no extra scripts) and gives you full control over how the share is presented. Modern browsers also support a Web Share API which, with a bit of JS, can trigger the native share sheet on mobile (allowing sharing to any app the user has, not just Facebook/Twitter). That requires HTTPS (which you’ll have on Netlify/Vercel) and is a nice touch for mobile users.

	•	What to Share: You might include share buttons on each game’s page (to share that specific game link), and maybe a generic one on the homepage to share the whole site. If you want users to share their high score, you could even craft the share text dynamically (e.g., “I scored 50,000 in [GameName]! Can you beat it?” as the tweet text). This doesn’t require backend – you can include the score in the share URL from JavaScript when the user clicks the button.

Both approaches are easy to set up. Using a service like ShareThis is basically copy-paste, while manual links require a little HTML/JS but no external dependencies. Either way, social sharing can be done entirely on the client side.

Ease of Setup and Maintenance

The combination of the above choices will result in a site that is easy to deploy and maintain:
	•	No Complex Backend: Everything is done in the frontend or via your static host’s services. You don’t need to run a server or write backend code. This eliminates a whole class of headaches (no databases, no server auth, etc.). The site can be served on any static host (or even a simple web server) since it’s just files. All interactive features – filtering, score keeping, sharing – run in the user’s browser using JavaScript. This aligns with the Jamstack philosophy (decoupling frontend from backend) and keeps things simple.
	•	Simple Deployment: Using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel means updating the site is as easy as pushing a commit or uploading files. These platforms will build (if needed) and publish your site automatically on every change. Netlify and Vercel also provide instant rollbacks and preview deployments, which is great for maintenance. You’ll get free HTTPS without doing anything (Netlify/Vercel auto-generate SSL certs ￼ ￼), so your users can securely access the site and use features like Web Share API which require HTTPS.
	•	Scalability & Cost: All suggested hosting solutions have generous free plans. Unless your site goes viral and uses huge bandwidth, you’re unlikely to incur costs. And if it does grow, the static host will handle scaling (you won’t suddenly crash from too many users). Maintenance largely involves updating your game list or fixing front-end code – you won’t need to touch server infrastructure. This is very friendly to a one-person or small team project.
	•	Content Management: Initially, you can hard-code your games list (an array of objects or a JSON file containing game metadata like name, thumbnail, tags, etc.). Maintaining that by hand is fine for a modest number of games. If the number of games becomes large, you might consider using a static site generator or a headless CMS to manage content, but that’s optional. For example, a static site generator like Jekyll, Hugo, or Eleventy could read a data file of games and generate your HTML pages (homepage with random picks, tag pages, etc.). That would still be deployed to the same static hosts. However, given the requirements, you can absolutely start with a manual setup – a single HTML page with your grid, and a bit of JS for randomness and filtering.

In conclusion, a stack using static hosting + client-side features is perfectly suited for a simple games showcase. Platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel will host your site for free ￼ ￼. For functionality, small libraries (List.js for filtering, localStorage for scores, share button scripts) keep things lightweight and easy to implement. This approach keeps setup and maintenance minimal, so you can focus on adding cool games to your arcade rather than worrying about servers or complex code. Good luck with your arcade webpage!

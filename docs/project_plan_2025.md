# Arcade Hub Project Plan 2025

## 1. Project Cleanup & Environment Setup

### Cleanup Phase
- Remove unused Astro-related files (astro.config.mjs, src/*)
- Clean up unused dependencies in package.json
- Standardize the project structure to match the documented layout
- Remove any duplicate files in the root directory

### Python Environment Setup
- Create virtual environment
- Install initial development packages:
  - pytest (testing)
  - black (code formatting)
  - flake8 (linting)
  - python-dotenv (environment management)
  - requests (HTTP client)
  - jupyter (for prototyping/development)
- Generate requirements.txt

## 2. Design Principles

### Visual Design
- **Color System**: Define primary, secondary, and accent colors with accessibility considerations
- **Typography**: Establish font families, sizes, and weights for different contexts
- **Layout Rules**: Set spacing, grid systems, and responsive breakpoints

### Code Structure
- **File Organization**: Standardize directory structure and file naming
- **Naming Conventions**: Establish consistent naming for functions, variables, and classes
- **Code Standards**: Define coding style, documentation requirements, and best practices

### Performance
- **Loading Speed**: Set targets for initial load time and time-to-interactive
- **Asset Optimization**: Guidelines for image compression, code minification, and bundling
- **Performance Metrics**: Define key metrics to track and minimum acceptable values

## 3. Game Categories System

### Core Categories
- **Arcade**: Fast-paced, reflex-based games (e.g., Snake, Breakout)
- **Puzzle**: Logic and problem-solving games (e.g., Memory Match, Sudoku)
- **Strategy**: Planning and resource management games (e.g., Chess, Tower Defense)
- **Educational**: Learning-focused games (e.g., Math Quiz, Typing Tutor)

### Metadata Structure
- **Game Properties**: Define required and optional metadata fields for each game
- **Required Fields**: Title, description, category, difficulty, thumbnail, etc.

### Tagging System
- **Primary Tags**: Main category classification
- **Secondary Tags**: Additional descriptors for filtering and discovery

## 4. Process Documentation

### Game Development
- **Ideation Template**: Structured format for proposing new game ideas
- **Development Guidelines**: Technical standards and best practices
- **Testing Checklist**: Required tests before submission

### Quality Standards
- **Code Review**: Process and criteria for code evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**: Minimum performance requirements
- **User Experience**: Guidelines for controls, feedback, and accessibility

### Publishing Flow
- **Submission Process**: Steps for submitting a new game
- **Review Criteria**: Evaluation standards for acceptance
- **Publication Steps**: Process for adding approved games to the platform
